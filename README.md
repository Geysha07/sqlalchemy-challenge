# SQLAlchemy-challenge
In this challenge, we used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, Matplotlib and Flask to analyze climate data for Honolulu, Hawaii. 

To begin, we queried precipitation data for the the most recent 12 months of data. Then we created a line chart to show our results and a DataFrame showing summary statistics for the precipitation data. After that, we queried the station data in order to find which station had the most temperature observation data (TOBS). After that, we queried the results to obtain the previous 12 months of data for that station and created a histogram of the results. 

The second part of the challenge was to create a Flask API based on the queries we developed in the first section. We created routes that would return the information to users in JSON format.
